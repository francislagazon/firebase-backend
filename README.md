# Firebase Backend

firebase-backend


# TODO

* copy test from firebase-cms-functions

* put 'firebase-backend.module' on root folder



# Installation


## node_modules

* chalk is for testing in terminal for nice look.
* tyepscript is for compliing
* firebase is for forum model.
    * firebase SDK is needed only for typing in cloud functions to boost the compaitibility of forum model.
    * But for Angular, firebase SDK probably needed in forum model.
